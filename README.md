These are programs for the [IBM 1401](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401) computer.

The goal is to write a simple ray tracer. It will read a scene description from punch cards
and print the image on the printer using ASCII art.

The `circle.aut` program draws a circle on the printer. It was written to test the
loop and printing logic.

The `ray.c` program is a fixed-point ray tracer in C. It's the prototype code for the
real version. It prints the scene on the console. To run it, type `make`.

To run the `.aut` files, install ROPE (see below).
